# DAO FractionalizedNFT

This project implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages NFTs through **fractional ownership**, enabling **collective governance**, **revenue sharing**, and **secure exits** for its members.

##  What It Does

-  **Fractionalized NFTs**: Each NFT is split into multiple fractions, allowing ownership to be distributed among multiple DAO participants.
-  **Voting & Delegation**: Members vote with their fractional holdings and can delegate their votes to other members.
-  **Royalty Distribution**: Revenues (e.g. resale royalties) are proportionally distributed to fraction holders.
-  **Rage Quit Mechanism**: Members can burn their fractions and leave the DAO if they disagree with governance decisions.
-  **Governance**: On-chain proposal/vote/execute system via `GovernanceDAO`.
-  **Security & Transparency**: All logic is encoded in smart contracts, deployed and audited.

##  Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)
- Git & Node (for frontend or deployment automation)
- Sepolia ETH via [Infura](https://infura.io)
- MetaMask or private key

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briandekorodi/Homework5.git
cd Homework5
forge install
```

## üß™ Tests

We implemented 6 tests, 5 of which pass successfully:

| Test                                      | Status    |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `testMint()`                             | ‚úÖ Passed |
| `testDelegate()`                         | ‚úÖ Passed |
| `testRageQuit()`                         | ‚úÖ Passed |
| `testIntegration_DistributeRoyalties()`  | ‚úÖ Passed |
| `testFuzz_TransferFractions()`           | ‚úÖ Passed |
| `testGovernanceFlow()`                   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed (explanation below) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The `testGovernanceFlow()` fails due to `No fractions to vote with`. We decided not to patch this test forcibly in order to maintain system consistency. The error occurs because the governance contract expects voting power based on precise delegation logic, which could not be fully simulated in a unit test.

## üì¶ Build and Test

```bash
forge build
forge test
forge test --gas-report
```

---

##  Audit

### Static Analysis with Slither

```bash
slither .
```

See full audit in `audit/` folder.

---

##  Deployment

We deployed both smart contracts (`FractionalizedNFT` and `GovernanceDAO`) on Sepolia via Foundry using Infura and a MetaMask private key.

### Deploy Command

```bash
forge script script/DeployAll.s.sol:DeployAll \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/1929ddd49e934d72b3e4d629bed9e96b \
  --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --broadcast
```

> Replace `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with your MetaMask private key. Do **not** expose this key in public repositories.
