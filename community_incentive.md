## Community Incentive Strategy
To promote future contribution and adoption:

- **GitHub Issues Tagged "Good First Issue"**: We created several beginner-friendly development tasks on the GitHub repository. This encourages newcomers to engage and improve our DAO ecosystem.
  - Examples:
    - Add vote result display to UI frontend
    - Create event listener for successful proposals

More advanced integration (e.g. OnlyDust) was considered but deprioritized due to time.
